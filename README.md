# IT092IU - Principles of Programming Languages

## Course Overview
This repository contains lab exercises for the course **IT092IU - Principles of Programming Languages**, taught by Lecturer Lê Thị Ngọc Hạnh. The course covers various fundamental topics in programming languages, including lexical analysis, grammar parsing, functional and logical programming, data types, sequence control, and code generation. The labs span from Lab 01 to Lab 07, each focusing on different core aspects of programming language principles. This is the lab series for the **third semester of the academic year 2023-2024**.

   Introduction to lexical analysis, token generation, and recognizing patterns in programming languages.

2. **01/08: Lab 02 - Grammar + Parser**  
   Understanding grammars, syntax trees, and building parsers for validating and interpreting code structures.

3. **03/08: Lab 03 - Functional + Logical Programming**  
   Exploration of functional programming paradigms and logical reasoning using languages such as Lisp and Prolog.

4. **08/08: Lab 04 - Name - Binding - Scope**  
   Detailed study of variable naming, scope rules, and binding concepts in different programming languages.

5. **10/08: Lab 05 - Data Type**  
   Examination of data types, type systems, and type checking in programming languages.

6. **15/08: Lab 06 - Sequence Control**  
   Discussion on control structures, flow of execution, and managing control flow in various languages.

7. **17/08: Lab 07 - Code Generator**
